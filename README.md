# Student Grade Tracker

A simple Python-based Student Grade Tracker that allows users to manage student records, add grades, calculate averages, and display student information. This tool is perfect for educators, tutors, or anyone needing to track academic performance over time.

## Features

- **Add New Student**: Users can add new students to the system.
- **Add Grades**: Users can input grades for a student and track their performance.
- **Calculate Average Grade**: Automatically computes the average grade for each student.
- **Display Student Info**: View detailed information about a student, including their grades and average.
- **Interactive Menu**: A command-line menu to navigate through the options and manage student data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x or later.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-grade-tracker.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd student-grade-tracker
   ```

3. **Run the script**:

   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then execute the following:

   ```bash
   python grade_tracker.py
   ```

## How It Works

The program will present an interactive menu with the following options:

1. **Add New Student**: Enter the student's name, and a new student record is created.
2. **Add Grades for a Student**: Choose an existing student and input their grades. You can keep adding grades until you type a non-numeric value (e.g., 'done').
3. **Display Student Info**: View the student's grades and their average grade.
4. **Exit**: Exit the program.

```

## Error Handling

- **Non-numeric Input**: If a user enters a non-numeric value when adding a grade, the program stops accepting grades and moves on.
- **Student Not Found**: If a user attempts to add grades or view info for a non-existent student, the program will inform them that no student with the given name exists.
